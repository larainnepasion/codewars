# Codewars solutions

## About
This repository contains my solutions to various Codewars katas using JavaScript. I take on at least one coding challenge a day to improve my algorithmic thinking and really also to have fun (it's slightly addicting)!

## Disclaimer
- Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at these until they have completed (or at least attempted) the kata themselves
- Codewarriors should not submit these solutions as their own
- I will not be accepting contributions to this repository
- Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars
